            <h2>What coding was for me</h2>
            <div>Initially when i took engineering i was not at all interested in coding, i thought it is something i              cannot do felt like its some rocket science which i cannot understand. But the fact is i never ever
            tried to understand it.I have made lot of mistakes that makes a sense as no one is perfect in this world but making a mistake and not learning anything from that mistake that does not make a sense isn't.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>My interest in coding</h2>
            <div>The interest for coding started only when one of my college friend suggested me about youtube playlist
                that was of Tanay pratap Sir, to go through and told its interesting. So one fine day i decided i will give
                a try by listening to it then turns out that i actually fell like i am playing a game when i actually
                started understanding it.I literally felt like why did i wasted my time during college days and did not
                tried this. But as its said its never too late and here i am starting this journey hoping to become
                coder someday and hack nasa sorry just joking.</div>
            <h2>The Journey</h2>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>My journey just started and i know its a long journey of learning new things daily because its not that
                easy to understand things but once you understand nothing is difficult atleast that is what i believe.
